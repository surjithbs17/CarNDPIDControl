### Results
Video of the simulated car in the track is [in home directory](output.mp4)

## PID Modules:
# P - Proportion
* Car steers in proportion to the CTE(Cross Track Error). CTE is a measurement to know how far the car is away from the middle line of the road.
	* The car steers right when the car is going left of the middle line
	* The car steers left when the car is going right of the middle line
	* The more the car that is away from the middle line, higher the steering angle. If the Proportional(P) coefficient is High, the car is going to oscillate a lot, as the car will constantly overcorrect and overshoot . If the coefficient is too low, the car may react too slowly to curves when the car gets off-center with a higher CTE.

# I - Integral
* It sums up all the CTEs. If the integral is negative, the car has been moving left and inorder to bring it back it has to steer to the right. 
	* Higher value for the coefficient of I will cause quicker oscillations
	* Lower value for the coefficient of I will cause the vehicle to drift

# D - Differential
* It is the derivative of the CTE function. Car will quickly steers if the derivatives change faster(In case of a big curve).
	* If the car is moving away from the middle, this will cause the steering to get larger similar to proportion, but if the car is moving closer to the middle (negative derivative), the car's steering angle will get smoothed out, leading to a more smoother driving experience.
	* Higher value of coefficient tends the car to go without much oscillations. 
	* Lower Valur for the coefficient will make the car oscillate a lot.

### Coefficient adjustment
* I started with close to zero values for steering angle , throttle to be a constant, and adjusted them according to its performance. I initially set the value of th I,D coefficients to close to zero. Set a value for P to start with, There were a lot of iterations where the car just goes and crashes. There were about 15-20 iterations to get it right. 

* Final values (0.1, 0.00001, 2) seemed to work pretty decently.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
